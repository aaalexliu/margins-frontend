# accountId not really necessary because of RLS but since you use condition
# for relaystyle pagination need to include one or else you get this apollo error:
# Missing field 'condition' while computing key fields

# weird bugs with pagination. using cursor based pagination returns null data with after cursor
# however offset based pagination doesn't work because the field has relayStylePagination.
# right now probably just best to limit results to 50 or 100, and write a custom function
# or fix the plugin
