# Overview

Margins is a simple product built on the latest production-ready tech stack. I
aimed to build a clone of Readwise, but with features I wanted and, critically,
cheaper than 8 dollars a month (I only pay 10 bucks a month for Spotify, an
infinite collection of music I can summon from the ether).

## The Stack
- PostgreSQL
- Postgraphile - an amazing open source library that I like better than Hasura, a VC-funded alternative
